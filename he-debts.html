  How Humans and Econs Face Debt
</div>

<div class="body-text">
    <br><br><strong>Humans:</strong>
    <br><br><strong>Emergency Funds</strong>
    <br><br>Imperative to the first step in your budgeting journey is the establishment of an emergency fund. You will find this recommendation in almost any personal finance book, along with the equivalent of my holy grail, r/personalfinance. 
    <br><br>Before I go into detail on how large your emergency fund should be, let’s start with why you should want this fund. Gone are the days of emergency funds being an envelope of 20’s tucked in sock drawers. A modern emergency fund will reside in a savings account with a trusted bank. It’ll be held all in cash and yield extremely low returns because of this. This is in exchange for the stability received by keeping your savings in their most liquid state. This fund is to only be utilized in the case of emergency. Think job loss, or sudden spikes in medical bills. Do NOT use this fund for predictable expenses, such as Christmas, or car maintenance.

    <br><br>Onto the size. 
    <br><br>Different authors will recommend differing amounts, but the overall consensus sizing for an emergency fund is between 3 and 6 months of expenses. Where you fall on the spectrum depends largely on personal factors. Do you have kids to take care of? Is your industry experiencing layoffs? What’s your risk tolerance? These are just a few of the questions that you should ask yourself before deciding on the size of your fund. 
    <br><br>Once you have reached a consensus, allocate part of your 20% post-tax income (as discussed in the Budgeting section) to your emergency fund. How quickly you will have this completed relies on the size of your monthly expenses, combined with your risk tolerance. People who have higher risk tolerances will slowly establish this fund, instead electing to invest the money into the stock market. Meanwhile, people with lower risk tolerances, or believe themselves to be more likely to undergo emergencies will typically look to complete this process quicker. 
    <br><br><strong>One Source of Debt</strong>
    <br><br>Debt as a word brings more than its fair share of negative connotations. When used correctly, it is used to buy homes, cars, education, etc. These are things that everyone needs to survive and advance in the world, so debt shouldn’t carry as many pessimistic undertones as it does. 
    <br><br>Nevertheless, we Humans tend to hate the idea of living with the cloud of a debt hanging over our heads. We value the peace of mind associated with being out from under that figurative cloud, and we make financial decisions in align with that notion. 
    <br><br>Whether it’s paying off a homes mortgage earlier than needed, or doing the same for student loans, Humans enjoy speed running through debt. If you are like this, you will allocate more money from your 20% take-home pay dedicated to investing, and instead put it towards your debts. Simple as that. How fast you do this all depends on how much you value being out from under the cloud. 
    
    <br><br><strong>Multiple Sources of Debt</strong>
    <br><br>If you have multiple sources of debt, your path isn’t as straightforward. 
    <br><br>The good news is many personal finance gurus have made their livings off of helping people with multiple sources of debt. Note that many people who turn to personal finance authors are there because they are drowning in debt. Because of this, the methods recommended by the finance gurus are tried and tested hundreds of thousands of times over. Meaning you should feel comfortable with the fact that they have helped so many. 
    <div class="image-wrap"><img src="images/debt.jpg" height="200 rem" class="image-wrap"></div>
    <br><br>By far the most common approach to tackling multiple lines of debt is the Snowball Method. 
    <br><br>The idea here is to begin with your smallest debt, measured by amount, and focus on paying that off first. For example, if you’re in debt to a bank from a $500 loan, and you also have $1000 in credit card debt, you should begin with paying off that $500 loan from the bank. The thinking behind this approach is that your Human brain will feel accomplished and motivated when you see that former source of debt closed. Because of this, you’ll be more likely to jump right into paying off that larger credit card bill. Thus, your snowball gradually builds. 
    <br><br>This strategy engages the psychology surrounding motivation and financial inertia. Instead of looking at debt as climbing over a huge mountain, it forces people to break it up into bite size pieces. It changes your mentality around debt, and the thousands of people giving positive feedback to these authors show that it works. 
    
    <br><br><strong>Econs:</strong>
    <br><br>Since you’re reading this, I will assume you’re seeking to act like an Econ in managing your debts. I will write with that assumption in mind. I won’t add flowery language to try and get your rear in gear. Econs don’t need extraneous sources to motivate them. Because of this, I will presume you need no nudging to:
    <br><br>1.	Finish reading this section, in its entirety.
    <br><br>2.	Act upon what you read. 
    <br><br>Let’s begin. 
    <br><br><strong>Emergency Funds</strong>
    <br><br>In the Human section of this article, I mentioned the need to establish an emergency fund. This is done via money held in savings account to be used in scenarios such as job loss and increased medical bills. This fund brings us to the first major difference between how Econs behave with debt vs. how Humans behave. 
    <div class="image-wrap"><img src="images/ef-2.jpg" height="200 rem" class="image-wrap"></div>
    <br><br>As discussed in Debt for Humans, the typical recommendation for an emergency fund is somewhere between 3-6 months of expenses. Economists have taken that rationale, run statistical tests, and written multiple papers, on why this is not a good idea. For example, a study authored by Charles Thatcher in the Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning shows that for a 3-month emergency fund to be warranted, a person would have to experience emergencies about once every 4 years. Planned expenses, such as car maintenance and ordinary healthcare bills do not constitute emergencies in this paper, nor should they in a Humans budget. It should also be noted that this paper uses the lowest bar for an emergency fund advised by popular financial authors. If Thatcher were to analyze an emergency fund’s effectiveness at 6-months expenses, instead of 3, he would be even more critical of its existence. 
    <br><br>Simply put, economic theory in its strictest sense does not recommend keeping an emergency fund. To be perfectly transparent, I couldn’t find explicit instructions from economists with what they recommend doing with your money if you’re not keeping it in an emergency fund. I believe this fact falls perfectly in line with how economists think, because the assumption here is that it will be lumped in and invested with the rest of your savings.
    <br><br><strong>One Source of Debts</strong>
    <br><br>For Econs with one source of debt, their decision tree is very simple. They first look at the interest rate on their loan. For example, let’s suppose you have a student loan at an interest rate of 4.5%. Over the past 100 years, the stock market has had an average annual rate of return of 10%. Subtract 2% per year because of inflation, and you’re left with about 8%. In this scenario, the Econ will make the minimum monthly payment on their student loan and invest the remainder into the stock market. Of course, the market doesn’t produce 8% returns every year. Sometimes it’s more, sometimes it’s less. But you’re an Econ and armed with the knowledge of the last 100 years, as well as basic arithmetic skills, and you will choose to invest.
    <br><br><strong>Multiple Sources of Debt</strong>
    <br><br>In the previous section (budgeting, if you’ve skipped around), I mentioned that your 20% of post-tax pay allocated to savings and debt repayment offers ample opportunity to act like an Econ. The further explanation you were promised is found below, but in summation, it may be more economical to only make the minimum monthly payments on some of your sources of debt. 
    <br><br>This is one of the biggest points of contention between economists and finance gurus. The gurus are typically writing for an audience that’s not very good at handling money. Think of them as very human Humans. It’s a self-selecting audience for the most part. If you’re having financial troubles, you seek out help. If you’re not having money problems, you don’t seek it out. Because these gurus know their audience, their recommendations for climbing out of debt are rife with strategies made for Humans. Strategies riddled with inefficiencies.
    <br><br>Take the Snowball Method mentioned in the Humans section as an example. 
    <br><br>In my previous fictional scenario, the Human had a debt from a bank in the form of a $500 loan. They also had $1000 in credit card debt. The finance authors almost unilaterally recommend paying off the $500 loan, and then shifting your focus onto the $1000 loan. The thinking behind this approach is that your Human brain will feel accomplished and motivated when you see that first former source of debt closed. Because of this, you’ll be more likely to jump right into paying off that larger credit card bill. Thus, your snowball gradually builds. 
    <br><br>Economists shudder at this idea. 
    <br><br>Their issue with the snowball method is its disregard for the interest rates associated with each debt. In the previous example, a credit card debt of $1,000 will typically come with an interest rate between 19% and 30%. Interest rates on loans from banks can vary wildly depending on multiple factors, but it’s safe to assume they won’t be anywhere close to 19%. By first focusing your payments on the smaller, $500 bank loan (aka the Snowball method), you end up paying more money than you would have if you decided to pay down the $1000 credit card debt. This is because you’re letting higher fees from interest rates rack up on the credit card. 
    <br><br>This is an inefficient way of bringing yourself out of debt. However, that label of inefficiency doesn’t necessarily mean you shouldn’t use the snowball method. Snowballing has helped tens if not hundreds of thousands of people stay focused on their climb out of debt. The finance gurus continue to encourage Snowballing, because they receive tons of feedback that this method helped people achieve their financial goals. It’s not perfect, but neither are Humans.
