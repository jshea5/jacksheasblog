  Are you a Human? Or an Econ?
</div>

<div class="body-text">
  <br>Humane Economics is a household finance blog dedicated to refereeing a proxy fight between two schools of thought. In one corner we have the Humans. Irrational, unpredictable, familiar, Humans. In the other corner we have the Econs. Logical, infallible, foreign, Econs. 
  <br><br>An Econ is the person who made your college economics class miserable. They are responsible for economics’ dull and dusty reputation. They are the reason why people believe economics is a difficult concept. And the weirdest thing is that they aren’t real. 
  <div class="image-wrap"><img src="images/econ-hero.png" height="200 rem" class="image-wrap"></div>
  <br><br>I’ll cut to the chase. An Econ is an economist’s vision for how people behave. They are figments of economist’s imagination. The field of economics was built upon several key assumptions, most notably, the theory that people optimize. When faced with a decision, they choose what’s best for them. People act rationally. 
  <br><br>It shouldn’t be too difficult to see where this is going. 
  <br><br>If you’ve been in the world long enough to find yourself scrolling through this obscure website, you know that people act irrationally. We’re driven and influenced by annoying things like emotions and society. We’re quick to act and slow to comprehend. We’re keenly aware of the short-term and barely cognizant of the long-term. We’re Human. 
  <br><br>Because I want you to keep reading, I’ve broken down a few differences between Humans and Econs into an easy to digest format.  
  <br><br><strong>Characteristics of an Econ</strong>
  <br><br>-	Unaffected by emotions and social pressures
  <br><br>-	Intuitively understands complex financial decisions.
  <br><br>-	Cold-hearted dedication to numbers and optimization
  <br><br><strong>Characteristics of a Human</strong>
  <br><br>-	Influenced by others.
  <br><br>-	Non-perfect impulse control
  <br><br>-	Needs to put food out of sight in order to stop eating it.
  <br><br>Humans have a distinct tendency to overestimate their abilities. We all believe ourselves to be above-average  which is, of course, impossible. If you’re sitting here reading about the characteristics of Econs and thinking “Hey! That sounds like me! I’m an Econ!”, you have fallen precisely into the line of thinking that ensures your humanity. Though it’s possible to act more like an Econ relative to your Human peers, I can promise you, you are not an Econ. You are not as cold-hearted and calculating as you may think. You are influenced and changed by the world around you. You are imperfect and flawed in your thoughts and actions, because you are Human.

  <br><br>That is why this website is for you. 
  <br><br>In the first sentence of this post, I mentioned that this blog is refereeing a proxy fight. Now that you’ve met the fighters, it’s time you meet the kingpins. 
  <br><br>They are the economists (for Econs) and finance gurus (for Humans). I have compiled research and recommendations from both the gurus and the economists. My goal is to cover the major personal finance categories, and summarize the differing strategies suggested by the two camps. I’m going to explain what an economist says an Econ should do, while contrasting that with the strategies suggested by the finance gurus. At the end of each section, you’ll have the most optimized economic strategies. You’ll also have the strategies used by millions of people to reach their financial goals. They aren’t the same. 
  <br><br>You’ll have a choice to make. If you think you’re up to the challenge, you can follow the path of Econs. If you can admit your humanity, you can follow the Humans. Either path will lead you to your financial goals. My guess is that by allowing you to choose between the two styles, you will be more likely to realize your goals. The choice is left to you.
