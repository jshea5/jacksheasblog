    <br><br>Out of everything I’ve written so far, this section has given me by far the most trouble. Ironically, investing has far and away more available academic literature, meaning determining how Econs invest was pretty easy. 
    <br><br>My trouble is derived from the Human side of the puzzle. Most of the personal finance books I’ve been referencing devote very little time to investing. It seems that the spotlight in these books is primarily trained on budgeting and climbing out of debt. This is most likely a result of the self-selection bias I’ve written about before. In any case, there’s an abundance in research on Econs investing habits, but a dearth for Humans. 
    <br><br>Another partial explanation for difficulty in writing this section is my hunch that investing is the easiest portion of personal finance to act like an Econ. I attribute this to the common notion that debt in particular, but also budgeting, feel like the boogeymen that people would rather not face. To tackle debt, one has to accept that they’ve spent more than they had, which is often a mistake. It’s easy to run away from that, so there’s been a lot of brainpower put into helping Humans leave debt. Investing isn’t the same story.
    <br><br>When investing, we aren’t starting from a negative and working towards 0. We’re starting from a positive and working towards a larger positive. The forces of inertia are at work with both debt and investing, but my theory is that the forces vary in strength.  
    
    <br><br><h3>Humans:</h3>
    <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Order of Operations</span>
    <br><br>Once you’re out of debt, priority number 1 is ensuring you don’t fall back into it. This is the stated goal for many finance gurus, so every recommendation in investing will be playing more defense than offense.  
    <br><br>For starters, the gurus write that any money needed in the short-term should be held in a bank account. “Short-term” is a time horizon relative to each author. For some it means a year, for others it means 10. 
    <br><br>Money designated for use beyond the “short-term” (read: retirement), would first flow into a 401(k) which would hopefully be matched up to a certain percent by an employer. This is the extent of Guru’s advice regarding the order of operations for your money. 
    <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What to invest in</span>
    <br><br>As has been repeated throughout these essays, popular financial authors really know their audience. Because most people who look for help in this domain tend to struggle with money management, the strategies that these gurus tout are shaped for simplicity and ease.
    <div class="image-wrap"><img src="images/searching.jpg" height="200 rem" class="image-wrap"></div>
    <br><br>Advice in the Human domain is never universal since you’re absorbing information from an array of sources. Sticking to generalities, however, leads us to some common themes. To begin with, when pondering the decision of investing in stocks vs. bonds, many gurus recommend that your portfolio percent of stocks should be “100 – your age.” For example, if you’re 23, your portfolio should be 23% bonds and 77% stocks. Next year, when you’re 24, your portfolio should read 24% bonds and 76% stocks. 
    <br><br>You can see why this is an easy rule of thumb for Humans to follow. Not much thinking is involved, and it achieves the goal of making your investment portfolio less risky as you move onto later stages in life. 
    <br><br>Personal Finance Gurus typically aren’t in the business of selling you the next hot stock, which is a good thing for their readers. They tout the financial benefits of mutual funds, and the psychological benefits of spurning day-trading. However, beyond recommending mutual funds, the only common words of wisdom from these authors are to “pick companies that have a history of successes and you believe in.” It seems that readers of popular financial self-help books are left to their own when explicitly deciding where to invest.

    <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Timing your Investment</span>
    <br><br>When beginning one’s investment journey, you may find yourself with a huge wad of cash that’s been sitting in a bank account. How to deal with that lump is a point of anxiety for many. Many personal finance authors suggest slowly exposing your money to the market. For example, if you have $40,000 that you want to invest, you might break it up into 10 monthly payments of $4,000. This is to mitigate any risk you might encounter by shoving the lump sum into the market all at once. This strategy helps people sleep better at night, and is thus the recommended course of action for Humans. 
    <br><br><h3>Econ:</h3>
    <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Order of Operations</span>
    <br><br>Econs think in terms of marginal utility. In other words, “How is this next dollar I spend going to give me the most satisfaction.” It doesn’t matter to an Econ if that satisfaction is realized today or 40 years from now. 
    <br><br>Because of this distinction, Econs are going to be excellent at saving for retirement! They know about the wonder of compounding interest, and they’re going to milk it for all it’s worth. When deciding which account to invest in first, an Econ will be heavily dispositioned to max out their retirement accounts. 
    <br><br>First, they will recall that any 401(k) matches offered by their employer is essentially “free money” and they will contribute up to that cutoff point (4% - 6% is typical). From there, they will begin funneling money into their other account meant for retirement, their IRA. Most Econs will open up Roth IRA’s instead of the traditional IRA because they know that their tax bracket is more likely to be higher in the future than it is right now. 
    <br><br>After the maximum of $6500 is contributed to the IRA, some forks appear in the road. If they have large personal expenses on the somewhat near horizon, such as a new car or house, they will dedicate more money to a traditional brokerage account. If they anticipate high health care costs in the future because of family history, they will instead focus on an HSA. Finally, if neither of these options apply, they will contribute the maximum to their 401(k). If there’s anything left over after that, it can be placed in the brokerage account. 
    <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What to invest in</span>
    <br><br>Though an Econ is a being with unprecedented will power, precise knowledge of their marginal utility, and an internal financial calculator, they are still unable to predict the stock market. They don’t know whether Apple’s going up or down tomorrow, nor do they know when the market will turn bear or bull. 
    <br><br>They do, however, have data on the last century of stock market returns. Humans all have access to this too, they just lack the wherewithal to act upon it. 
    <br><br>I’ve said this before, but it bears repeating; when adjusted for inflation, the stock market returns around 8% annually. It is very, very, very hard to beat that rate of return. Some argue it’s impossible. This fact isn’t enough to spurn the millions of American investors who attempt to beat the market when picking their stocks. Econs know it’s a fruitless endeavor, but humans have an aversion to average results. People always want to be above average, which is a desirable quality in most Human pursuits, but when it comes to investing, is poison. 
    <br><br>Countless studies have shown that the more people day trade, the worse their rates of return are. On top of that, brokerage fees and transaction costs cut into all buys and sells. The best thing you can do for your investments is to act like an Econ. Accept your mediocrity in picking the winning stocks, and instead shift your focus to ETF’s. 
    <br><br>ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are low-cost index trackers. Buying a share in an ETF is basically like buying 100 small shares in individual stocks. For example, there are technology ETF’s, energy ETF’s, health care ETF’s, etc. They are similar to mutual funds, but typically have much lower expense ratios (read: lower fees). There are many papers comparing the merits of “setting and forgetting” money in a variety of ETF’s versus active trading of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The papers nearly universally conclude that putting money in ETF’s and not touching it for decades will be the optimal choice for your investments. 
    <br><br>When deciding what to buy with their retirement and other long-term savings, Econs will exercise their will power, and consistently purchase the low expense ETFs.

    <br><br>Ok, this is a pretty easy section if you’ve already read the Budgeting passage. If not, go read it before continuing. 
    <br><br>So, the amount that we’ve settled on is 20% of take-home pay. Econs would follow this rule and then some. Econs don’t really keep a budget, so this is a tricky section to write. I’ll just repeat that Econs are cognizant of the fact that $1 today could be $60 40 years from today, and they have no preference for when to enjoy that $1.
    <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Timing your Investment</span>
    <br><br>When faced with how to invest a lump-sum of money, Econs have a very straightforward approach. There are piles of research that support investing all of your lump-sum in one swift action. This is because, over the long run, stocks tend to go up! This holds especially true if you decide to place your lump-sum into a long-tern low-expense ETF (which you should). The Dollar Cost Averaging approach advertised to Humans is sub optimal, because it means your money spends less time in the market. It’s not exposed to the same swings of the market, as the lump-sum strategy brings. This is valuable for Human’s state of mind, but it’s not a concern of Econs.
