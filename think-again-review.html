  <h2>Think Again Book Review</h2>
</div>

<div class="body-text">
  <br><br>It’s been a month and a half since I finished this book, and I didn’t take any notes. So, please forgive me for not readily diving into the specifics. I’m sure I’ll find my way at some point in this review. 
  <br><br>This book was part of the reason why I started this blog. I’ve created dozens of workout plans, YouTube channels, calories trackers, websites, business ideas, etc. that have never seen follow through on my end. I have so many interests and it’s like I have little corners in my mind for each of the interests. Be it writing, coding, exercise, sports, whatever. I’ve tried to create individual platforms where I track my bench-press or write about the Eagles, but those have unfailingly fallen by the wayside when my attention shifts to something new. <br><br>I’ve always disliked that fact. I want to be gritty and pick something and stick to it. But even knowing that and constantly thinking about it, I still can’t get myself to pick something and stick to it. 
  <br><br>That’s where Adam Grant and Think Again enter the arena. To no one’s surprise, Think Again is about the power of rethinking. As many psychologists have pointed out, we as a human species are cognitively lazy. Our minds create a path typical for thinking, and we stick to that path. It helps us out with simple things, like recognizing a table. But it’s not so great in more nuanced situations. 
  <br><br>This ties back in with my story about starting and stopping projects ad infinitum because it showed me that I shouldn’t be too hard on myself for struggling to pick an area to focus. Instead of going all in on a website dedicated to writing, or trying to code an app, or starting a sports economics blog, I should allow myself to explore these passions, in a concentrated place. That place is this blog. 
  <br><br>The final chapter of Think Again is entitled Escaping Tunnel Vision: Reconsidering Our Best-Laid Career and Life Plans. The content is better than the name. 
  <br><br>In this concluding chapter, he writes about how weird it is that we ask children what they want to be when they grow up. This question is a glimpse into how we view the action of choosing our careers. So many people get a job when they turn 18 or when they leave college, and that is what they become. A consultant, plumber, doctor, and teacher. People go into one industry right out of college, and never leave it because that industry is now where they have experience. They don’t Think Again. 
  <br><br>This blog is me giving myself avenues to consistently rethink what I want to do. I don’t know if it involves writing, coding, data analytics, or some combination of the three. I’m constantly picking things up and putting them down. But now, they’re all being plucked and placed in a shared space.
