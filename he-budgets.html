  How Humans and Econs Budget
</div>

<div class="body-text">
  
<br><br><h3>Econs:</h3>
This entry will probably be my easiest to write because the concept of a budget to an Econ is alien and trivial. You see, Humans create budgets because we lack the self-control and foresight to spend our money wisely without them. A budget is a self-imposed limit to our spending, which is necessary for Humans who lack self-control, and a powerful financial calculator imbedded in our heads. 
<br><br>Econs, however, don’t suffer from these afflictions. Because of this, a budget would harm their terminal goal of complete optimization. While beneficial for Humans, budgets violate a major tenant of economics - money is fungible.

<br><br>This is a fancy way of saying that you shouldn’t earmark a certain amount of dollars, or even a single dollar, for one particular category. For example, let’s suppose you’ve decided you can spend $200 on video games per month. A new console, which you are dying to buy, is released, but it costs $300. This is over your monthly allowance, so if you’re committed to your budget, you’ll put off buying it. You should not act like this. A highly desired skill of Econs is knowing exactly how a dollar is best spent. You should be putting each dollar in your possession to its best use, even if that means violating a previous cap on your spending. If you’re truly dying to buy the console, the surplus you get from spending those extra dollars will outweigh whatever else they were earmarked for. 
<br><br>Of course, it’s impossible to know your exact surplus gained from each dollar spent. This is a trait of Econs, not Humans. If buying that console means the power goes out in your apartment, your dollars haven’t gone to their best use. Humans, which value immediate gratification over drawn-out gratification will of course have trouble with this riddle. 
<br><br>In short, a budget limits your ability to optimize your dollars. They shrink your surplus yield from each dollar. In a world of Econs, they don’t exist because they violate fungibility. You, however, are not an Econ. You are a Human, and you need a budget. 

<br><br><h3>Humans:</h3>
If you are ever to accept your humanity, it’s with this topic right here. As has been established, you probably suffer from impulse control more than you’d care to admit. More importantly, I sincerely doubt your ability to keep a mental excel spreadsheet with accurate figures on expenses. 
<br><br>Because of this, we budget.
<br><br>Before diving too deep into what your budget should look like, I want to review why you should want to budget. Here are the three big reasons.
<br><br>-	To ensure you have enough money for everyday expenses. (Rent, groceries, phone bills.)
<br><br>-	To save money for once in a lifetime events. (Retirement, kids going to school, marriage (hopefully.))
<br><br>-	Allowing you to indulge yourself a little every day. Videogames, eating out, new clothes.
<br><br>The big 3 of budgeting splits off nicely into the most tried and true budgeting method: The 50 – 30 – 20 strategy. 
<div class="image-wrap"><img src="images/snowball.jpg" height="200 rem" class="image-wrap"></div>
<br><br>This approach sees you first calculate your post-tax pay per month. (What you take home with every paycheck.) Next, 50% of that amount is dedicated to your essential-to-living expenses. Think rent, groceries, electric bills. After that, 30% of your money goes towards your “wants.” Whether it’s a new set of golf clubs, or fancy dinners, this is stuff that you can live without, but makes life worth living. Finally, 20% of your post-tax pay goes towards savings and debt repayments. *Note: This is the step where my most “Econ-striving” readers can differentiate themselves from the pack. See my Article on Debt* 
<br><br>This strategy for saving works because it allows for more indulging than investing, while simultaneously increasing one’s savings rate exponentially. Remember that a core flaw in Humans is their lack of perfect impulse control. This, compounded with Human’s imperfect assumptions on how much they spend in all categories, leads to Humans indulging more and saving less. Beginning your adventures in budgeting with this breakdown ensures that you won’t get bogged down with wondering “Is my grocery bill too high? What about rent?” If you can fit your essentials within that 50% you don’t have to worry about the individual category allocations. Finally, not only is the 50-30-20 approach to budgeting endorsed by countless finance gurus, but it’s also approved by my Bible, the personal finance subreddit. If economists could stoop to the level of thinking about household finances, they’d probably do the same.  
<br><br>As I mentioned before, the 20% of post-tax pay allocated to savings and debt repayment offers ample opportunity to act like an Econ. This is covered at length in the debt section on this website, but in short, depending on your interest rates, it may be more economical to only make the minimum monthly payments. 
<br><br>This is one of the biggest points of contention between economists and finance gurus. The gurus are typically writing for an audience that’s not very good at handling money. Think of them as very human Humans. It’s a self-selecting audience for the most part. If you’re having financial troubles, you seek out help. If you’re not having money problems, you don’t seek it out. Because these gurus know their audience, their recommendations for climbing out of debt are rife with strategies made for Humans. Strategies riddled with inefficiencies. 
<br><br>A paper by the Yale Economist James Choi has shown that X of the 50 most popular personal finance books recommend a debt-reducing strategy termed “The Snowball Effect.” The idea is to begin with your smallest debt, measured by amount, and focus on paying that off first. For example, if you’re in debt to a bank from a $500 loan, and you also have $1000 in credit card debt, you should begin with paying off that $500 loan from the bank. The thinking behind this approach is that your Human brain will feel accomplished and motivated when you see that former source of debt closed. Because of this, you’ll be more likely to jump right into paying off that larger credit card bill. Thus, your snowball gradually builds. 
<br><br>Economists shudder at this idea. 
<br><br>Their issue with the snowball method is its disregard for the interest rates associated with each debt. In the previous example, a credit card debt of $1,000 will typically come with an interest rate between 19% and 30%. Interest rates on loans from banks can vary wildly depending on multiple factors, but it’s safe to assume they won’t be anywhere close to 19%. By first focusing your payments on the smaller, $500 bank loan (aka the Snowball method), you end up paying more money than you would have if you decided to pay down the $1000 credit card debt. This is because you’re letting higher fees from interest rates rack up on the credit card. 
<br><br>This is an inefficient way of bringing yourself out of debt. However, that label of inefficiency doesn’t necessarily mean you shouldn’t use the snowball method. Snowballing has helped tens if not hundreds of thousands of people stay focused on their climb out of debt. The finance gurus continue to encourage the snowball, because they receive tons of feedback that this method helped people achieve their financial goals. It’s not perfect, but neither are Humans.
