  <h2>Outliers Book Review</h2>
</div>

<div class="body-text">
  <br><br>This book was a tale of at least 2 parts. I began reading Outliers in March of 2023 and didn’t finish until mid-August. In fact, I’m pretty sure I had picked up and put down this book multiple times before finally finishing it a few days ago. 
  <br><br>I don’t particularly know why it took me multiple iterations to complete this novel. It’s engaging and written in Gladwell’s usual style, which I am typically quick to work through. Nonetheless, it took me months to wrap things up. 
  <br><br>It was a journey to finish, but it was far from an arduous trip. Gladwell brought in many interesting characters and stories, all weaved together in an easy-to-digest narrative. The thesis of Outliers, at least my interpretation of the thesis, is that our concept of success is flawed. We attribute accomplishments to micro-attributes, when macro-attributes are just as, if not more important. 
  <br><br>When we think of what makes someone successful, we conjure images of a person with a back breaking work ethic, and the ability to see past the near-term. If we’re taking a slightly more nuanced approach, we also attribute success to the wealth of the family they were born into, or what educational opportunities were available to them. These are important considerations, as Gladwell mentions in nearly every chapter, but they are only one side of the coin. 
  <br><br>What truly separates the wheat from the chaff are elements completely out of a person’s control. This thesis is obvious from Chapter 1. 
  <br><br>Gladwell introduces research into Canada’s youth hockey league and explains why macro-attributes are responsible for most of the NHL players you watch today. In Canadian hockey leagues there is a cutoff date, January 1st, for each age group. This means that there can be kids born 364 days apart competing in the same age group. This might not be a big deal if the players were mostly 24, but the nature of a youth hockey league is that the players are youths! When this fact is coupled with the fact that Canada begins selecting players for “Elite” teams when they’re 7 years old, it produces a huge discrepancy in the skill pool. 364 days of maturation is a significant amount when you’ve only been alive for a 2,500. The kids born in early January and February have a big advantage over the kids born in November and December. They’re bigger, stronger, faster, and are more likely to be chosen for the “Elite” team, which gives them access to more intensive and frequent coaching and development. The end result is a disproportionate amount of NHL players born in the early months, compared to the later months. 
  <br><br>These examples of macro-attributes to success are all around us, as illuminated by Gladwell. 
  <br><br>Outliers is split into 2 parts. The first, entitled Opportunity, focuses on being in the right place at the right time. Bill Gates became the richest man in the world, not just because he was smart and hard-working, but because his life was full of a myriad of incredibly rare opportunities. The Beatles music played all over the world, not because they were innately talented, but because they had tens of thousands of hours to hone their skills. The lists go on, and in more detail, but I’ll leave that to Gladwell.
  <br><br>The second part is entitled Legacy. In this section, Gladwell dives into the cultural influences that we all grow up with. He explores how cultures shape the way we view the world, and the way the world views us. From an abundance of Korean plane crashes to exceptional middle-schools in the Bronx, bearing our cultures in mind is an important step in comprehending success. 
  <br><br>I love this kind of book. It makes me think about the Freakonomics tagline, “exploring the hidden side of everyday things.” After reading this, it becomes so apparent that macro trends such as birth rates and states of the economy affect micro-outcomes. It’s easy to think about after someone such as Gladwell points it out, but hard to stumble upon without a guide. I highly recommend this book.
